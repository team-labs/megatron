Installation
------------

Megatron is a fully featured Django app and generally follows the microservice
pattern. Getting up and running in a production environment is highly dependent
on your existing architecture.

That being said, thanks to the magic of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), getting running with megatron locally
is a pretty painless process.
