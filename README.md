<p align="center"> Chatbots in disguise!</p>

Megatron allows engineers, customer-service, and occasionally CEOs, to peer into 
a live DM channel between the your chatbot and a customer. Your're able to 'become 
the bot' through Megatron, sending responses directly from your existing chatbot. 
Best of all, this happens from within your existing app. **There's nothing 
more your customers need to install or authorize, and no external tools for you.**

---

Here's how a quick example of how it works:
1. Phil, a customer, gets stuck trying to talk to your bot
2. Jane, your customer service rep at, opens a channel on your team. This 
channel immediately imports the conversation between Phil and your chatbot.
3. Jane pauses the bot and responds to Phil in the new channel on your team. 
e.g "Hi Phil. I see you're having some trouble make a purchase. I'm here to help!"
4. Phil receives that message on his own team, **from the bot he was just 
talking to.**
5. Phil and Jane continue speaking **across two different teams** until 
the issue is resolved and Jane closes the channel, unpausing Phil's bot.

It's that easy.
